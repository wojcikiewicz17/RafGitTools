# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for the RafGitTools project. These workflows automate various aspects of the development lifecycle including building, testing, security scanning, releasing, and more.

## 📋 Overview of Workflows

### Core CI/CD Workflows

#### 1. **CI** (`ci.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push/PR to main/develop branches, manual dispatch

**Purpose**: Main continuous integration pipeline

**Jobs**:
- **Build**: Builds all variants (devDebug, devRelease, productionDebug, productionRelease)
- **Test**: Runs unit tests and generates reports
- **Lint**: Performs code linting checks
- **Code Quality**: Runs code quality checks

**Artifacts**: APKs, test results, lint reports, code quality reports

---

#### 2. **PR Validation** (`pr-validation.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened)

**Purpose**: Validates pull requests before merge

**Jobs**:
- **Validate**: Builds, tests, and lints PR changes
- **Label**: Automatically labels PRs based on changed files

**Features**:
- Checks PR title format (Conventional Commits)
- Posts results as PR comment
- Analyzes APK size

---

#### 3. **Release** (`release.yml`)
**Trigger**: Git tags (v*.*.*), manual dispatch

**Purpose**: Automates release creation and distribution

**Jobs**:
- **Build Release**: Builds **signed** production release APK

**Features**:
- Early fail if required signing secrets are missing
- Keystore decoding from `RELEASE_STORE_FILE_BASE64`
- Automatic version extraction
- Changelog generation
- GitHub release creation
- APK artifact upload

---

#### 4. **Internal Validation** (`internal-validation.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pull requests to main/develop, manual dispatch

**Purpose**: Runs unsigned `assembleProductionRelease` only for internal validation (no official release publishing)

**Jobs**:
- **Unsigned Validation Build**: Builds production flavor with explicit `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_RELEASE=true`

**Features**:
- Isolated unsigned validation lane
- Uploads unsigned APK artifact for verification
- No GitHub Release publishing

---

### Security & Quality Workflows

#### 5. **Security Scan** (`security.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push/PR to main/develop, daily schedule (2 AM UTC), manual

**Jobs**:
- **Coverage**: Runs tests with coverage and generates reports

**Features**:
- JaCoCo integration (if configured)
- Coverage report artifacts

- PR comments with metrics

---

### Automation & Maintenance Workflows

#### 8. **Documentation** (`docs.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push/PR affecting docs, manual

**Purpose**: Validates and generates documentation

**Jobs**:
- **Validate**: Checks markdown syntax and links
- **Generate Docs**: Creates API documentation (Dokka)
- **Check README**: Verifies README completeness

**Features**:
- Markdown linting
- Link checking
- Spell checking
- API doc generation

---

#### 9. **Nightly Build** (`nightly.yml`)
**Trigger**: Daily schedule (3 AM UTC), manual

**Purpose**: Comprehensive nightly build and test

**Jobs**:
- **Nightly Build**: Builds all variants, runs tests, performs linting
- **Statistics**: Generates repository statistics

**Features**:
- Builds all variants
- Creates issue on failure
- Generates nightly version
- Repository statistics

---

#### 10. **Stale Issues and PRs** (`stale.yml`)
**Trigger**: Daily schedule (1 AM UTC), manual

**Purpose**: Manages stale issues and PRs

**Configuration**:
- Issues: Marked stale after 60 days, closed after 7 more days
- PRs: Marked stale after 30 days, closed after 14 more days
- Exempt labels: `keep-open`, `pinned`, `security`, `critical`

---

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)
Automated dependency updates for:
- Gradle dependencies (grouped by category)
- GitHub Actions

**Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 9 AM UTC

---

### Auto-labeling (`labeler.yml`)
Automatic PR labeling based on changed files:
- `documentation`: Markdown and docs files
- `code`: Kotlin/Java source files
- `ui`: UI and theme files
- `tests`: Test files
- `build`: Build configuration
- `ci/cd`: Workflow files
- And more...

---

### Documentation Tools
- `markdown-link-check.json`: Link checking configuration
- `spellcheck.yml`: Spell checking configuration

---

## 📝 Templates

### Issue Templates
Located in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
1. **Bug Report** (`bug_report.md`): For reporting bugs
2. **Feature Request** (`feature_request.md`): For suggesting features
3. **Documentation** (`documentation.md`): For documentation issues

### Pull Request Template
`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: Comprehensive PR template with checklists for:
- Description and related issues
- Type of change
- Testing requirements
- Code quality checklist
- Documentation updates
- Security and performance considerations

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Running Workflows Manually

All workflows support manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`. To run manually:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select branch and provide inputs (if required)
5. Click **Run workflow**

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **PR Title Format**: Use Conventional Commits format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `refactor:` for refactoring
   - `test:` for tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance

2. **Wait for Checks**: All PR validation checks must pass before merge

3. **Review Artifacts**: Check uploaded artifacts for issues

4. **Security Alerts**: Address security findings promptly

### For Maintainers

1. **Monitor Nightly Builds**: Review nightly build failures

2. **Review Dependabot PRs**: Keep dependencies up to date

3. **Manage Stale Items**: Review stale issues/PRs before auto-close

4. **Release Process**:
   - Tag commits with semantic version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   - Release workflow triggers automatically
   - Review and edit generated release notes

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
Required secrets (configure in repository settings):
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub
- `PLAY_STORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: For Play Store publishing (optional)

### Permissions
Workflows use minimal required permissions:
- Read: For checking out code
- Write: For creating releases, commenting on PRs
- Security-events: For uploading security scan results
